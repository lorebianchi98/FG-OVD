# Detector inference scripts
These scripts are designed for conducting inferences on the benchmarks using various detectors. For proper execution, insert these scripts into the official directory of the corresponding detector within the correct environment. 
# Additional Notes
- The default Detic installation does not return total_scores (i.e., the scores for every class in the vocabulary for each box). To enable this functionality, install the customized version of Detectron2 at https://github.com/lorebianchi98/detectron2.
